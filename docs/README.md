# TechNotDrip Engine
TechNotDrip is an engine for [Friday Night Funkin'](https://funkin.me/) made by TechnikTil and CrusherNotDrip!

The source code is made from the ground up rather than forking the engine itself although most of the assets used are still from [FunkinCrew/funkin.assets](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/funkin.assets).
